## Aims

I was tasked with testing out the registration form for http://demoqa.com/registration/, making sure the input fields, select menus and check boxes worked accordingly. I used Selenium to run tests on the website to mimic the way a user would interact with the website, providing valuable information vital in UI testing.

Methods I used to test the UI:

* Setting the first name
* Getting the first name field value
* Checking if the first name field is displayed

* Setting the last name
* Getting the last name field value
* Checking if the last name field is displayed

* Selecting the marital status check box

* Selecting the hobby check box

* Selecting the country element
* Selecting a country in drop down menu
* Checking the first country in drop down menu

* Selecting a month from the dropdown menu
* Selecting a day from the dropdown menu
* Selecting a year from the dropdown menu

* Setting a phone number
* Getting the phone number field value
* Checking how many digits the phone number has

* Setting the user name
* Getting the user name field value

* Setting the email
* Getting the email field value

* Setting your description
